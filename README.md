# Angular Pikaday Directive

This directive lets you use Pikaday as an Angular directive.

**Note:** To use this fork, add this to your `bower.json` dependencies:

    "angular-pikaday-directive": "HornsAndHooves/angular-pikaday-directive#0.0.1.6"

It will allow you to use the `v1.4.x` series of `pikaday`.
